# FAQ
## Note to new players
I suggest instead of using blueprints building the actual factory from a picture at first or better yet designing your own system first and then looking up the blueprints. You learn how things work and why they work they way they do. So this repo of blueprints is a good place to get ideas but not copy straight out right.

## How to use Blueprints?
As of v0.15 you can use blueprints from the start of the game. 
- Copy the blueprint string you want to use. 
- Enter the game and open the blueprint window copy in the string.
- Give it a name
- Save and you now have a stampable blueprint
Note: if you haven’t researched a particular item used in the blueprint it will show as a ghost placement until you build and place it.

## Why use Github and not [Factorio Prints](https://factorioprints.com/)?
I wanted more control. Github gives me version control, my own layout, and a quick way to back up and share blueprints. Really its just personal preference. Factorio Prints is an excellent site.

## What is Factorio?
Factorio is factory building simulation game. The premises is that you have crash landed on a planet. You need to process the raw resources on the planet to eventually build a rocket to send a satellite to orbit so you can be rescued. The local alien bug swarms don’t like your dirty factories pollution. Although that is far to simple an explanation and the game is so much more.
